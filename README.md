You can use this template to start developing your own [Compose Multiplatform](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform#readme) mobile application targeting Android and iOS.
Follow our tutorial below to get your first Compose Multiplatform app up and running.
The result will be a [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) project that uses the Compose Multiplatform UI framework.
